After the translation completed, the dev team will update the language resources with latest texts.

Transifex has some useful features like a dictionary feature. Feel free to use it if it is useful. Any suggestions are welcome!

## Adding new language

If you want to add new language. Please request new language via Transifex system. However, we may not accept every languages due to reviewing capacity limit.

## For developers

If you have something new texts which needs translation, please add the strings to `../assets/locales/ja.json` and make a pull request to `dev-i18n`branch. You can use same string for key and value.

We are using [nuxt-i18n](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n) as a translation system. Please refer [their document](https://nuxtjs.org/examples/i18n/) to know how to use the library.

When you need to get translated text immediately, please ask to push the latest changes from Transifex in the #covid19 channel in Code for Japan Slack (see [our respos](https://github.com/tokyo-metropolitan-gov/covid19/blob/development/docs/en/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-participate-in-communications)).

After the text was translated, an organizer will apply new resources on the `dev-i18n` branch.
