### When developing with VSCode + Remote Containers

1.	The VSCode extension "[Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)" is introduced.
2.	If you select the “Open Folder in Container” root of this repository (as seen in the lower left [here（external site）](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-try-a-dev-container)), the environment construction will start.

#### Notes
- If you want to change the settings, modify `'.devcontainer/devcontainer.json `'. Please refer to [devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_devcontainerjson-reference) for more details.
- The extension "ESLint" is only valid when executing Remote Container. Please add it to the `'extensions `' of `'devcontainer.json `' if necessary.
- A detailed procedure can be found [here（external site）] (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_managing-extensions).
- When rebuilding the development environment, please execute “Rebuild Container” which can be found at the lower left.

### Detect production/others environment

On the production environment, `'production'` is assigned to `process.env.GENERATE_ENV` variable, on the other case `'development'` is assigned to the variable.  
Please use the variable to detect which enviroinment is used at the runtime.

### Deployment to Staging & Production Environments

When `master` branch is updated, the HTML files will be automatically built onto `production` branch,
and then the production site (https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/) will be also updated.

When `staging` branch is updated, the HTML files will be automatically built onto `gh-pages` branch,
and then the staging site (https://stg-covid19-tokyo.netlify.app/) will be also updated.

When `development` branch is updated, the HTML files will be automatically built onto `dev-pages` branch,
and then the development site (https://dev-covid19-tokyo.netlify.app/) will be also updated.

### Branch rules

Pull Request is allowed only for `development` and `dev-hotfix`.
Please use the following naming rules for the branch when sending a Pull Request.

Feature implementation: feature/#{ISSUE_ID}-#{branch_title_name}  
Hotfix commit: hotfix/#{ISSUE_ID}-{branch_title_name}
