## 2. Run this program

The command is executed in the working copy root directory.

### 2-1. Using `yarn`

#### 2-1-1. Install dependencies

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install
```

#### 2-1-2. Run this program

After executing the following command, you can check the program under development by accessing http://localhost:3000 .

##### 2-1-2-1. Normal

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```

##### 2-1-2-2. Faster

You can disable accessibility auditing, which would make your local server faster.

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev-no-axe
```

### 2-1-3. Troubleshoot

#### 2-1-3-1. How to resolve `Cannot find module ****` error

Build the dependency again and run the program.

### 2-2. Using `docker compose`

#### 2-2-1. Install dependencies and run this program

After executing the following command, you can check the program under development by accessing http://localhost:3000 .

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ docker-compose up --build
```

### 2-2-2. Troubleshoot

#### 2-2-2-1. How to resolve `Cannot find module ****` error

Stop the program and execute the following command.
```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm app yarn install
```

### 2-3. Using `Vagrant`

#### 2-3-1. Install dependencies and run this program

After executing the following command, you can check the program under development by accessing http://localhost:3000 .

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ vagrant up
```

### 2-4. When developing with Visual Studio Code and Remote Containers

#### 2-4-1. Install dependencies and run this program

If you select the “Open Folder in Container” root of this repository (as seen in the lower left [Quick start: Try a dev container (external site)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-try-a-dev-container)), the environment construction will start.

You can check the program under development by accessing http://localhost:3000 after building the environment.

#### 2-4-2. Notes

- If you want to change the settings, modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Please refer to [devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_devcontainerjson-reference) for more details.
- The extension "ESLint" is only valid when executing Remote Container. Please add it to the `extensions` of `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if necessary.
- A detailed procedure can be found [Managing extensions (external site)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_managing-extensions).
- When rebuilding the development environment, please execute “Rebuild Container” which can be found at the lower left.

## 3. Detect production/others environment

On the production environment, `'production'` is assigned to `process.env.GENERATE_ENV` variable, on the other case `'development'` is assigned to the variable.  
Please use the variable to detect which enviroinment is used at the runtime.

## 4. Deployment to Staging & Production Environments

When the branch listed in the left column of the table below is updated, the branch and website will be updated automatically.

| branch | A branch where HTML is built and updated | Website updated |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|`master`|`production`|The production site https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/|
|`staging`|`gh-pages`|The staging site https://stg-covid19-tokyo.netlify.app/|
|`development`|`dev-pages`|The development site https://dev-covid19-tokyo.netlify.app/|
